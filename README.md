```

## Setup

### Database
1. Create the database and tables:
   - Import `uiu_talent_show.sql` into MySQL.

### Backend
1. Ensure PHP can write to `backend/uploads`.
2. Update PHP upload limits in `php.ini`:
   - `upload_max_filesize = 4G`
   - `post_max_size = 4G`
3. Start the PHP server:

```bash
cd backend
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Media URL Base
The frontend resolves media from `frontend/src/utils/media.ts` (`MEDIA_BASE_URL`).
Make sure it matches the PHP server address (default `http://localhost:8000`).
